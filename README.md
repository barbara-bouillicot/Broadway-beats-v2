<h2>Broadway Beats - Discover, Play, Repeat: Your Stage, Your Playlist</h2>
Broadway Beats is a mobile web app about musicals built with Ruby on Rails and Spotify API

📝 About
-----
A fun mobile-web project I built to use the Spotify API and play around with web scraping. You can see some details about your favorite musicals, add them to your faves and then listen to the corresponding album. You can even create a playlist.

🚀 Features
-----
- **Music player**: When the user select a song, the player is being displayed
- **Authentication with Spotify**: The user must sign-in directly with Spotify from the app, and is redirected to the app after being signed in.
- **Play, pause and resume**: You can play a track, pause it, and resume it.
- **Favorites**: The user can add a musical to his favorites.
- **Playlists**: The user can create a playlist of songs from his favorites musicals.

🛠️ Technologies

- Ruby on Rails
- Stimulus JS
- Vanilla JS
- Bootstrap
- Scss
- API

💡 Improvements
-----
- **Responsive design**: So far the web app is designed for mobile screens only, will need to be adapted to laptops as well.
- **Changing tracks from music player**: For the moment, there is no previous and next buttons to change tracks, you have to select the song.
- **Adding events**: I would like to add the corresponding events maybe using an API like Ticketmaster.
